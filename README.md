wordpress-setup
===============

A typical wordpress setup. This could be setup for themes or plugins. The idea here, is to use the src directory to create either a theme or a plugin, then utilize composer for external dependencies, and do automated testing on the src stuff

This assumes that ant, npm, and composer are available globally on the machine. There are a number of articles written on how to accomplish this.
